CLAUDE.md Automation Solutions for SQL Server Code Analysis Tool
================================================================

This document provides comprehensive automation strategies for keeping CLAUDE.md 
documentation up-to-date across different CI/CD platforms.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================

The solution includes:
1. GitHub Actions workflow for automatic CLAUDE.md updates
2. Azure DevOps pipeline equivalent
3. Python scripts for intelligent change detection and documentation generation
4. Flexible triggering mechanisms for different development scenarios

IMPLEMENTATION OVERVIEW
======================

The automation system works by:
- Monitoring key files for changes (sql_analyzer.py, Analyze-SqlCode.ps1, config.json, etc.)
- Analyzing the nature and impact of changes
- Automatically generating updated CLAUDE.md content
- Creating pull requests or direct commits with the updates
- Providing detailed change summaries for review

KEY COMPONENTS
=============

1. GitHub Actions Workflow (.github/workflows/update-claude-md.yml)
----------------------------------------------------------------
   - Triggers on changes to critical files
   - Supports both push and pull request workflows
   - Includes manual trigger with force update option
   - Creates PRs for pull request-based changes
   - Direct commits for push-based changes
   - Comprehensive artifact management

2. Azure DevOps Pipeline (azure-pipelines.yml)
---------------------------------------------
   - Equivalent functionality to GitHub Actions
   - Supports Azure DevOps specific features
   - Integration with Azure Key Vault for secrets
   - Artifact publishing and retention
   - Build-specific information inclusion

3. Change Analysis Script (scripts/analyze_codebase_changes.py)
-------------------------------------------------------------
   - Intelligent detection of significant changes
   - Impact scoring based on file importance
   - Git integration for commit information
   - File-specific analysis (Python, PowerShell, JSON, Markdown)
   - Configurable thresholds for update triggers

4. Documentation Generator (scripts/generate_claude_md.py)
--------------------------------------------------------
   - Comprehensive codebase analysis
   - Dynamic content generation based on current state
   - Git information integration
   - Build metadata inclusion
   - Structured template with consistent formatting

WORKFLOW TRIGGERS
================

Automatic Triggers:
- Changes to sql_analyzer.py (high priority)
- Changes to Analyze-SqlCode.ps1 (high priority)
- Changes to config.json (medium priority)
- Changes to requirements.txt (medium priority)
- Changes to SQL schema files (high priority)
- Changes to documentation files (low priority)

Manual Triggers:
- Force update via workflow dispatch
- Build system integration
- Release preparation workflows

UPDATE SCENARIOS
================

1. Code Changes (Automatic)
   - Developer pushes changes to main files
   - Workflow detects changes and analyzes impact
   - If impact score > threshold, generates new CLAUDE.md
   - Creates commit with updated documentation

2. Pull Request Changes (Automatic)
   - PR includes changes to monitored files
   - Workflow creates separate PR with CLAUDE.md updates
   - Links to original PR for context
   - Allows review before merging

3. Release Preparation (Manual)
   - Use workflow dispatch to force update
   - Ensures documentation is current for release
   - Includes build and release information

4. Scheduled Updates (Optional)
   - Weekly/monthly scheduled runs
   - Catches any missed changes
   - Baseline documentation refresh

CHANGE DETECTION ALGORITHM
==========================

Impact Scoring:
- High priority files (sql_analyzer.py, Analyze-SqlCode.ps1): +10 points
- Medium priority files (config.json, requirements.txt): +5 points  
- Low priority files (examples, docs): +2 points

Trigger Thresholds:
- Score >= 5: Always update
- New CLI arguments detected: Always update
- New classes/major functions: Always update
- Configuration structure changes: Always update

File Analysis Types:
- Python files: Classes, functions, imports, CLI arguments
- PowerShell files: Parameters, functions, cmdlet features
- JSON files: Configuration sections and structure
- Markdown files: Section headers and code blocks

CONTENT GENERATION STRATEGY
===========================

Dynamic Sections:
1. Command examples based on actual CLI arguments
2. Architecture overview from code analysis
3. Configuration options from config.json
4. Dependencies from requirements.txt
5. File structure from directory analysis
6. SQL schema information from database files

Static Sections:
1. WSL connection configuration (from global guidelines)
2. Common troubleshooting patterns
3. Development best practices
4. Testing approaches

Metadata Inclusion:
- Generation timestamp
- Git commit information
- Build IDs and URLs
- Change summaries

PLATFORM-SPECIFIC FEATURES
==========================

GitHub Actions:
- Uses GitHub API for PR creation
- GitHub token authentication
- Issue/PR linking and commenting
- Artifact retention with GitHub storage

Azure DevOps:
- Azure CLI integration
- Work item linking capabilities
- Azure Key Vault integration
- Pipeline artifact publishing
- Team notification options

DEPLOYMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
==========================

For GitHub:
1. Add CLAUDE_API_KEY secret (if using Claude API)
2. Ensure workflow permissions include contents:write
3. Enable Actions in repository settings
4. Test with workflow_dispatch trigger first

For Azure DevOps:
1. Set up service connection for repository access
2. Configure pipeline permissions
3. Add necessary variable groups
4. Enable pipeline triggers

MAINTENANCE CONSIDERATIONS
=========================

Regular Tasks:
- Review and update file monitoring patterns
- Adjust impact scoring thresholds based on experience
- Update template sections as project evolves
- Monitor workflow execution and success rates

Quality Assurance:
- Test workflows in development branches
- Validate generated documentation accuracy
- Monitor for false positives/negatives
- Gather feedback from team on usefulness

EXTENSIBILITY OPTIONS
====================

Additional Integrations:
- Slack/Teams notifications
- Jira ticket creation for documentation reviews
- Wiki page updates
- API documentation generation
- Release note automation

Advanced Features:
- ML-based change significance detection
- Natural language commit message analysis
